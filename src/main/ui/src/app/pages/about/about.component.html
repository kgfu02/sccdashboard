        - Hi! This site was made by Kevin Fu. I'm currently a high schooler at Lynbrook High School.<br><br>
        - I made this website to show changes and trends of Covid-19 in individual cities since the official dashboard currently only shows present day counts. <br><br>
        - All data is sourced from sccgov.org/sites/covid19/Pages/dashboard.aspx. Updates usually occur between 12-5 pm depending on the official dashboard. <br><br>
        - As of right now planned features include: new cases chart option, county-level stat counter (e.g cases, deaths, hospitalizations, positivity rate, etc), and zipcode data.<br><br>
      - If you have any feedback or comments, send them to <span style="color: #b19cd9;font-weight: bold">cov19scc@gmail.com</span>
